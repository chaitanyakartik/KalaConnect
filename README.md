# Artisan Marketplace Platform

> A web platform connecting independent artisans directly with customers, fostering fair trade and celebrating the stories behind handcrafted goods.

This project is a React-based frontend for an online marketplace designed to empower independent craftspeople. It provides them with the tools to showcase their work, share their stories, and reach a broader audience without intermediaries.

## üåü About The Project

### The Problem
Independent artisans and craftspeople often struggle to reach broader audiences, secure fair compensation for their work, and communicate the unique stories behind their products due to limitations of traditional retail channels and existing online marketplaces. This results in restricted economic opportunities and a lack of cultural appreciation for handcrafted goods.

### The Solution
This platform directly connects artisans with customers, facilitates equitable payment, and highlights the story, cultural context, and ethical value of each product.

The proposed solution aims to:
* **Enable** artisans to display and sell their work online without intermediaries.
* **Ensure** transparent pricing and fair compensation for creators.
* **Promote** storytelling by allowing artisans to share the origin, craftsmanship, and meaning behind each creation.
* **Foster** a community that values authentic, ethically produced goods and supports local creative economies.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Category Exploration:** Users can browse through various craft categories like Pottery, Fishing, and Handicrafts.
* **Artisan Discovery:** Discover talented artisans for a specific item, view their origin, and read their stories.
* **Mission-Driven Homepage:** A landing page that clearly communicates the platform's values and goals.
* **Responsive Design:** A clean and modern UI that works on all devices, built with Material-UI.
* **Scalable Architecture:** Built with modern React and Vite, using CSS Modules for maintainable, component-scoped styling.
